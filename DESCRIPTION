Description: A set of functions providing several visualization tools for exploring the behavior of the components in a network meta-analysis of multi-component (complex) interventions: 
   - components descriptive analysis
   - heat plot of the two-by-two component combinations 
   - leaving one component combination out scatter plot 
   - violin plot for specific component combinations' effects
   - density plot for components' effects  
   - waterfall plot for the interventions' effects that differ by a certain component combination 
   - network graph of components
   - rank heat plot of components for multiple outcomes.
