\title{Waterfall plot}
\usage{
watercomp(model, sep = "+", combination = NULL, random = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An object of class \code{\link[netmeta]{netmeta}}.}

\item{sep}{A single character that defines the separator between interventions components.}

\item{combination}{A single character that specifies the component combination of interest.}

\item{random}{\code{logical}. If \code{TRUE} z-values are obtained from the random-effects NMA model instead of the fixed-effect NMA model.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{ggplot}.
}
\description{
The function produces a waterfall plot based on the z-values from the interventions that differ
by one specific component combination.
}
\details{
The function based on the intervention's z-values obtained from the network meta-analysis (NMA) model
visualizes all the observed interventions that differ by one specific component
combination, in order to explore if the one extra component combination from every comparison
has a positive or negative impact. Bars above or below of the \eqn{y = 0} line,
indicates that the inclusion of the extra specific component combination has an impact on the
intervention. The direction of the impact (positive or negative), depends on the outcomesâ€™ nature
(beneficial or harmful).

The combination of interest is defined from the argument \code{combination}. By default the
function visualizes the interventions that differ by one component (\code{combination = NULL}).
If for example \code{combination = "A+B"}, the function plots the interventions that differ
by "A+B".
}
\note{
In the case of dichotomous outcomes, the log-scale is used.
