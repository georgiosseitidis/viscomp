The goal of viscomp is to provide several visualization tools for exploring the behavior of the components in network meta-analysis: 
   - heat plot for the two-by-two component combinations 
   - leaving one component combination out scatter plot 
   - specific component combinations violin plots
   - components density plot 
   - waterfall plot for the interventions that differ by a specific component combination 
   - components network graph 
   - components rank heat plot for multiple outcomes 
   - hasse diagram.
